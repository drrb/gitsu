### About Gitsu

Gitsu helps to manage your projects' Git users by making it easy to switch
between users.

Gitsu lets you:

- quickly switch between Git users
- switch to multiple users at once for paring

{% highlight console %}
$ git su jg
Switched to user John Galt <jgalt@example.com>
$ git su raphe
Switched to user Raphe Rackstraw <rack@example.com>
$ git su jg rr
Switched to user 'John Galt and Raphe Rackstraw <dev+jgalt+rack@example.com>'
{% endhighlight %}
