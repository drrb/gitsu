## About Gitsu

Gitsu helps to manage your projects' Git users by making it easy to switch
between users.

Gitsu lets you:

- quickly see which user Git will use to commit
- quickly switch between Git users
- configure a list of Git users to switch between
- switch to multiple users at once for pair programming
