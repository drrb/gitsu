### Acknowledgements

#### Git pairing concept

The idea of having a tool to acknowledge multiple users in Git commits was taken
from [Hitch](https://github.com/therubymug/hitch).

#### Site layout

The site layout (based on a GitHub pages template) was heavily inspired by the
[page of rspec-puppet](http://rspec-puppet.com).
