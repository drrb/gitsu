Bugs
-------
When I type 'git su -c', I see
    fatal: unable to read config file '/etc/gitconfig': No such file or directory
When I try to switch to a user whose name contains an apostrophe, I see
    sh: -c: line 0: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `''
    sh: -c: line 1: syntax error: unexpected end of file
    Switched local user to John O'Grady

    And user doesn't change, even though output says it does
